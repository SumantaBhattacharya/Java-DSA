    // [Additional Notes]:
    // Note: The time complexity of this linear search algorithm is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.
    // This is because in the worst case scenario, the algorithm will have to iterate through every element in the array.
    // If the array is sorted, the time complexity can be reduced to O(n+m) or O(min(n,m)).
    // However, in most practical scenarios, the time complexity remains O(n*m) due to the nature of the problem.
    /*If the 2D array is fully sorted and treated as a 1D sorted array, 
    we can apply binary search to achieve O(log(n*m)) complexity.
    If the 2D array is not sorted, we can still use a binary search algorithm on each row or column to achieve O(log(n) + log(m)) complexity.
    But in this case, the space complexity would be O(log(n) + log(m)) due to the recursive calls in the binary search.
    If the 2D array is extremely large, it might be more efficient to use a different algorithm or data structure, such as a hash table or a balanced search tree.]
    In conclusion, the linear search algorithm is a simple and straightforward solution for searching for an element in a 2D array.
    However, it has a high time complexity and may not be suitable for large data sets.
    For efficient searching in large 2D arrays, consider using a data structure like a hash table or a balanced search tree.
    If the 2D array is sorted, consider using a binary search algorithm to achieve better performance.
    If the 2D array is not sorted, consider using a binary search algorithm on each row or column to achieve better performance.
    If the 2D array is fully sorted (row-wise and column-wise), consider using a 
    binary search algorithm to achieve O(log(n*m)) time complexity.
    If only each row is sorted (but not the entire array), apply binary search on 
    each row separately to achieve O(n log m) time complexity.
    If each column is sorted, apply binary search on each column separately 
    for O(m log n) time complexity.*/
